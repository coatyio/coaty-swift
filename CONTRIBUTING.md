## Workflow

Contributions should be incorporated into the repository using pull requests on
a separate branch. We use the [GitHub Pull Request Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
The mentioned link is the recommended documentation to read and understand this workflow.

## Automatic versioning and changelog management

We are using the [Conventional Commits Style](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
for our commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Conventional Commits Style helps structuring Git commit messages in a way that
allows automatic generation of changelogs. These conventions form the basis for
automatic version bumping and CHANGELOG management when cutting a new release.

For details, see the section [Release Coaty framework](#release-coaty-framework) below.

## License and Copyright Notice

CoatySwift source code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
Attach a license and copyright notice to the top of each created source files as follows:

```swift
// ! Copyright (c) <year> <contributor>. Licensed under the MIT License.
```

`<year>` specifies the year of *first* publication and must *not* be changed
when you modify the contents of the file later on. Do *not* add additional
copyright notices or dates when the work is revised at a future time.

Contributions without this header on each new source file won't be accepted.

The meaning of source file covers all files, which allow adding a comment
easily (e.g. `.swift`, `.md`) and contribute to the core value of the
project by adding originality (e.g. no `.editorconfig`, etc.).

Documentation and media work (such as icons) should be licensed under

## Coding Style

The framework includes a custom linter configuration that conforms to our
style guide and should also be used in Coaty application projects.

## Build Coaty framework

Install the project's dependendies from the `Example/` folder:

```sh
pod install
```

Open the new `CoatySwift.xcworkspace` file in XCode, you should now be able to build and run the
Example application including the CoatySwift framework.

## Generate Coaty framework documentation

The framework documentation can automatically be generated by using [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy).
From the root directory of the repository run:

```sh
jazzy
```

Execute the command to generate HTML documentation from the Swift
source code and the included comments. The generated documentation
is written to the `docs/swiftdoc/` folder and accessible using a web browser and the `index.html` file.
The Jazzy configuration is located in the `.jazzy.yaml` file in the repository root.

## Test Coaty framework

```
    TODO
```

## Release Coaty framework

```
    TODO
    - Prepare a release
    - Push a release
    - Publish a release
```
