  s.description      = <<-DESC
  Using the Coaty [koÊŠti] framework as a middleware, you can build distributed applications out of decentrally organized application components, so called Coaty agents, which are loosely coupled and communicate with each other in (soft) real-time. The main focus is on IoT prosumer scenarios where smart agents act in an autonomous, collaborative, and ad-hoc fashion. CoatySwift agents can run on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
