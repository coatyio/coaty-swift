## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. We provide two additional examples located in the `Example for CoatySwift` folder:

- `Hello World` which is a CoatySwift implementation of Hello World [this](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/hello-world/js) example. This example demonstrates the basic use of communication event patterns to exchange typed data in a distributed Coaty application.
- `Switch Light` which is a (simplified) CoatySwift implementation of coaty-js [Remote Operations](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/remote-operations/js).
- Additional examples can be found in the `swift` section of `coaty-examples`, including a macOS version of the Hello World example.
